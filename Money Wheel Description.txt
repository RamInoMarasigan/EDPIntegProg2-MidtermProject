This is a WPF C# application developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. It was created as a midterm project for our 3rd year’s 1st semester, specifically for the subjects ‘Event Driven Programming’ and ‘Integrative Programming and Technologies 2’. The project involves developing a casino-related game. Upon launching the application, the user selects a power level and then presses the spin button. Various boxes light up and eventually land on a prize. The prizes are shuffled each time the application is opened, but once the spin button is pressed, the prizes remain in their positions.
